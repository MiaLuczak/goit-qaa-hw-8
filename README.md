JSON (Java Script Object Notation) <br>
file structure starts with curly brackets {} that opens and closes the structure, after opening the curly bracket in a new line we start to write a key which is used to access its value, all key should be write in double quotes and have a colon after end,
the value should be written in corresponding data-type syntax, space between colon and value is necessary, and after it, if we have another key: value pair a colon should be placed.
Note: JSON doesn't allow trailing commas at the last key: value pair
