## <div align="center">Task 1</div>

> Analysis of user.json file <br>(Specifying key: value pair and data type of each value and representing overall JSON file structure)

Provided [JSON file](./user.json):

![user.json file](./imageFiles/Code%20I%20HW%208%20I%20Task%201%20AI.png)

Using JSON data from user.json as a JS object to comment (JSON files doesn't allow comments)

![user.json data commented](./imageFiles/Code%20I%20HW%208%20I%20Task%201%20BI.png)

JSON (Java Script Object Notation) <br>
file structure starts with curly brackets {} that opens and closes the structure, after opening the curly bracket in a new line we start to write a _key_ which is used to access its _value_. <br>
All _key_ should be write in double quotes and have a colon after end,
the _value_ should be written in corresponding data-type syntax, space between colon and value is necessary, and after it, if we have another _key: value_ pair a colon should be placed.
Note: JSON doesn't allow trailing commas at the last _key: value_ pair

## <div align="center">Task 2</div>

> Analysis of JSON.parse() method

Creating a JS Object from JSON data string

![Task 2 JSON.parse() method](./imageFiles/Code%20I%20HW%208%20I%20Task%202%20I.png)

JS Object that was created using the JSON.parse() method corresponds its properties and values with the keys and their values from the JSON string, which can be seen in Node.js Terminal output

## <div align="center">Task 3</div>

> Parsing invalid JSON string, using `tryâ€¦catch` to handle errors

Using invalid JSON data string:
`'{"info": Invalid JSON String}'`

![Task 3; Parsing invalid string and catching errors](./imageFiles/Code%20I%20HW%208%20I%20Task%203%20I.png)

`try...catch` Construction tries to execute a code that is in `try` block, if an error is thrown in this block, `catch` part catches the error and handles it. <br>
This solution benefits, that even if a runtime error occurs, code isn't stopped, which can be seen in Terminal output (Arrow function was still executed besides `JSON.parse()` error occurs)
